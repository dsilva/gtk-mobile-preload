gtk-mobile-preload is a shared library meant to be loaded on top of GTK through LD_PRELOAD.  It overrides portions of the GTK API to make desktop applications more usable in a constrained screen (a phone, usually).

Examples of what the library does include:
  * hiding menus
  * hiding toolbars
  * hiding status bars
  * hiding scroll bars

Of course, the functionality those widgets provide has to go somewhere.  That's on the TODO list :)

------

Compiling:

  1. Make sure you have the GTK headers (libgtk2.0-dev on debian)
  2. Make sure you have ghc
  3. Right now the Makefile is hardcoded to use ghc 6.12.1.  Edit if necessary.
  4. make

Testing:
  1. Install gjiten (on debian, apt-get install gjiten)
  2. Open gjiten normally
  3. Open a second instance of gjiten with gtk-mobile-preload: make run
