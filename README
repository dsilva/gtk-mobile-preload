gtk-mobile-preload is a shared library meant to be loaded on top of GTK through LD_PRELOAD.  It overrides portions of the GTK API to make desktop applications more usable in a constrained screen (a phone, usually).

Examples of what the library does include:
  * hiding menus
  * hiding toolbars
  * hiding status bars
  * hiding scroll bars

Of course, the functionality those widgets provide has to go somewhere.  That's on the TODO list :)
